    <P>The reason I chose the University of Florida is because the campus is really nice and the atmosphere around the school is really pretty. There are also cool amentities around the school such as a state-of-the-art gym and has a studio that you can use to work hard. Also their basketball and football games they say are really fun to watch, so that could interest me since I'm a big sports guy. The price for this place is 4 years for $176,356, which is extremely expensive. If youre ON STATE, it would be $87,244</P>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-6">
    <P>The reason I chose Clemson Univserity is because it studies mostly on the subject I want to learn, office management and supervision. It does some classes about how to supervise people and how to keep an area of an office neat, nice, and smooth so that others can feel satisfied when they enter your office. I also heard their campus is really beautiful and they have a nice fountain outside the college. Their sports is also legit since they won the College Football Championship about 4 years ago. The price for the class is about $136,656 for 4 years. </P>

<h1>The Study</h1>
<img class="man" src="Images/Office.jpeg" alt="office">
<h1>Office Management</h1>
<P class="idk">The reason I chose this study is because I would like to manage and supervise others so that things wont mess up and things would go smoothly. I would like to organize things such as the decorations or the way the office runs so that everyone can be satisfied and yet still be productive for a good amount of time before they leave the office. There are many universities that focus on supervision, so I chose the two best ones which are the ones I named on top, and I like the univerisites in general too. I also had experience supervising people to make things organized and neat so everything can be normal and everyone can be satisfied. The annual salary is about $45,655 per year from December 2023.</P>
