        <p>Basketball easily tops the list as my favorite sport, there are runners up I will mention later, but by far this is my favorite. The entertainment, the game, the scoring, the dunking, the humiliation, the elegant way you play the game is just overall a masterpiece. I have been watching and playing this game for many years. I didn't love it at first, but at the end I enjoyed it and now its my favorite sport to watch and play. My favorite player all time of course is Michael Jordan, as a fellow Chicagoan and won't give up, plus brought a lot to the city and changed the revolution of the sport forever. This sport will be forever my favorite sport, and I will continue to play it until my hands give up.</p>

        <p>Soccer (Football) will come in a close second. I didn't watch a lot of soccer when I was younger because I'm American and Americans barely watch soccer besides the FIFA World Cup. But after the 2022 World Cup, I fell in love with the sport. The beautifull passing, dribbles, shots, celebrations, defending, saving, all beautiful to the game. Now I watch all the leagues or keep up with them at least, like the Premier League, La Liga, Champions League, Bundesliga, and more leagues that come from mostly Europe. My favorite player and my GOAT of soccer, Lionel Messi, since he does things that barely anyone can do. He's an alien, he dosen't belong on this planet because of how too much of a great player he was. I love this sport, and I hope to enjoy more in the future.</p>

        <p>American football comes last into this list, however it is my 3rd favorite sport to watch and play. Normally most youngsters would watch the American Football only when the Super Bowl is displayed, which is the championship of the NFL. However I did watch a lot of football after that, since 2019 now I've been watching many regular season games and playoff games to keep up with whats happening in the sport, mostly the league of the NFL. I also do enjoy playing the sport, since it feels satisfying to catch a ball in front of your friends face as you watch them see you score a touchdown. My favorite player here is Tom Brady, the GOAT of American Football, winning 7 titles and being extremely dominant in the sport, plus going undefeated one season until he lost in the superbowl. Anyways I love this sport too and continue to watch it!</p>

        <p>There is no doubt in mind that my favorite game so far is Rocket League. Rocket League is one of my favorite games to play since I do love soccer and cars. Combining both makes a beautiful game where you can play and score, and then you get better and better and maybe become of the top players in the world to this day. I got introduced into this game by my cousin back in December 2020, and now I have loved the game ever since, reaching a high of Champion 1, unfortuantely I am now at diamond 2 but I am trying to get back up. Also watching the RLCS, which is an esport battle of this game, is really exciting because you get to see the best players play and try to win a title. I overall love this game and can't wait for updates and cool modes for me to enjoy to come, and hope I can get better by the days.</p>

        <p>I started playing this game a few months ago, and only that because this game isn't recommended for kids and mostly for people who are close to reaching adulthood or are in adulthood, but when I played it I loved it. The action, the jobs, the fighting, the money, the cars, the luxury, it was all beautiful to watch and play. Playing GTA Online multiplayer has so much to offer, thats why I can keep a consistent amount of time playing this game and enjoying every second of it. My favorite part is the Diamond Casino Heist, where you rob a casino and can earn so much money, then I can use that money to buy flying cars and bikes! Overall a really fun game and you should play it too, if you're allowed to that is.</p>
